My Home CS-255-X6346 System Analysis and Design 21EW6

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for this project was DriverPass. A driver's education company that teaches students how to driver and pass the Department of Motor Vehicles driver's test. This company wanted an online student/staff portal that offered driver's packages, progress reports/tracking, instructor scheduling, online classes, and practice tests.

What did you do particularly well?

I did well with every aspect of the design, the UML activity diagrams I think is what I did best on the project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

In the UML object diagram is maybe where I should have gotten further clarification on what to do with that diagram. It was unclear whether the diagram needed to show the types of relationships or not. So, this is what I should have done to improve it.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I used the transcripts of the interview with the client and the consulting team to understand the user needs. Understanding the needs of the client is very important. With the client's input on the project, it help us build a solution that fits the client's needs.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

With the lessons learned during this course, I have gained the knowledge of the different UML case tools and how to implement these tools into a system design. I would use UML use case tools to start from a higher level understanding of the project, on to understanding the activities needed for the system design, and finally, get the details of technical objects needed for the project.
